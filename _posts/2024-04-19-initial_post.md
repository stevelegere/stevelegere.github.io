Hey there, fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts! üëãüèº

Thanks for stopping by! Hopefully by the time you've made it here, there's a fair bit of content available for you to check out!

## Who Am I?
I'm a cybersecurity researcher and advisor with over 15 years of industry experience under my belt. I started with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Carleton University, graduating in 2011. It wasn't until 2021 (when I started my current job) that I actually started to use some of the knowledge I gained from university! I'm also currently working through a Master's degree program in cybersecurity at the SANS Technology Institute.

## My Experience
From 2009 until 2021, I worked in the Department of National Defence (Canada), where I specialized in signals intelligence and cyber operations. All of my engagements and experiences during this time were leadership focused - getting the right people involved, keeping folks motivated, and ensuring everyone was taken care of. I learned a lot from my time as an army officer in the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals, and have taken those experiences with me as I transitioned from leadership roles to more technical and advisory roles.

I'm currently working for the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC), where I advise on cybersecurity matters, investigate cyber breaches, and keep update-to-date on the latest trends and developments in all things cybersecurity. Whether it's federal government departments or private businesses, I'm dedicated to safeguarding sensitive information and upholding privacy standards.

## What to Expect
In this blog, I'll be sharing my passion for cybersecurity through insightful posts, tutorials, and hands-on experiments. From exploring cutting-edge hacking tools and techniques to unraveling the mysteries of cryptography and digital forensics, we'll cover it all.

Expect deep dives into topics like:

* OSINT
* Cryptography and Password Cracking
* Log and Network Traffic Analysis
* Digital Forensics
* Scanning, Reconnaissance, and Exploitation
* IoT Devices and Hardware Hacking
* App Analysis and Mobile Devices
* Artificial Intelligence

I'm a huge fan of [Immersive Labs](https://www.immersivelabs.com/) and will likely use a lot of content that I learn on that platform to help feed my blogs. I've also just started tinking with [Hacker Boxes](https://hackerboxes.com/), so expect to see a few posts on these fun little toys, as well!

## Let's Learn Together
I believe in the power of continuous learning, which is why I'm committed to sharing my experiences and insights with you. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, there's always something new to discover in the world of cybersecurity. Join me on this exciting journey, and together, let's unlock the mysteries of cyberspace and empower ourselves with knowledge.
